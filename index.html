                <p>Well i'm not sure about the story nad it did seem biased. What
                    I disagree with is your statement that the U.S. Media is out to
                    ruin Israels reputation. That is rediculous. The U.S. media is
                    the most pro-israeli media in the world. Having lived in Europe
                    I realize that incidences such as the one described in the
                    letter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to
                    ignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the
                    Europeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think
                    that might be a reason they report more clearly on the
                    atrocities.</p>
                    <p>What is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of
                    the inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing
                    received from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt
                    go away. After all, look how the Jews are treating other races
                    when they got power. It is unfortunate.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6"

                <p>Yeah, do you expect people to read the FAQ, etc. and actually accept hard atheism?  No, you need a little leap of faith, Jimmy.  Your logic runs out of steam!</p>
                    <p>Jim,</p>
                    <p>Sorry I can't pity you, Jim.  And I'm sorry that you have these feelings of
                    denial about the faith you need to get by.  Oh well, just pretend that it will
                    all end happily ever after anyway.  Maybe if you start a new newsgroup,
                    alt.atheist.hard, you won't be bummin' so much?
                    </p>
                    <p>Bye-Bye, Big Jim.  Don't forget your Flintstone's Chewables!  :) </p>

                        <p>Although I realize that principle is not one of your strongest
                        points, I would still like to know why do do not ask any question
                        of this sort about the Arab countries.</p>
                                            <p>If you want to continue this think tank charade of yours, your
                        fixation on Israel must stop.  You might have to start asking the
                        same sort of questions of Arab countries as well.  You realize it
                        would not work, as the Arab countries' treatment of Jews over the
                        last several decades is so bad that your fixation on Israel would
                        begin to look like the biased attack that it is.</p>
                                            <p> Everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'Center for
                        Policy Research' is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot
                        who hates Israel.</p>

                    style="background-color: #94d6da;top:-20px;box-shadow:

                    <p>Notwithstanding all the legitimate fuss about this proposal, how much
                    of a change is it?  ATT's last product in this area (a) was priced over
                    $1000, as I suspect 'clipper' phones will be; (b) came to the customer 
                    with the key automatically preregistered with government authorities. Thus,
                    aside from attempting to further legitimize and solidify the fed's posture,
                    Clipper seems to be "more of the same", rather than a new direction.</p>
                                        <p>Yes, technology will eventually drive the cost down and thereby promote
                    more widespread use- but at present, the man on the street is not going
                    to purchase a $1000 crypto telephone, especially when the guy on the other
                    end probably doesn't have one anyway.  Am I missing something?</p>
                                        <p>The real question is what the gov will do in a year or two when air-
                    tight voice privacy on a phone line is as close as your nearest pc.  That
                    has got to a problematic scenario for them, even if the extent of usage
                    never surpasses the 'underground' stature of PGP.</p>
